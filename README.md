This arduino code and excel spreadsheet demonstrate how to use a typical automotive coolant sensor and interface it with an arduino.
Typical automotive coolant sensors are just thermistors in an industrial casing, and typically don't come with data sheets.
You must collect values by hand and plug it into the steinhart equation to find the constants that you can use in an arduino code.
